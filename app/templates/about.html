                        Hello, my name is Christian and I am a student of Hunter College studying computer science. <br>
                        I created this project as my first beginner web application/CRUD project to familarize myself with flask and overall web development. <br>
                        I learnt a lot from this and I couldn't have done it without the help of online tutorials and resources. <br>
                        I hope you find this project useful and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me!
                    </p>
