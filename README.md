# Worked with flask, python, html, css, bootstrap

# Prefix
Hello, to get things started, this is my beginning project and sorta my first project
Im currently entering my junior year of college at the time of writing this
When starting this project, I used a lot of resources to get an understanding

# Idea
I had the idea way before I knew of any of this, however I had no knowledge in web development at all
I decided to look online how does one start a project let alone web develop and found out flask
I set up flask and found an incredible resource to learn from, Miguel Grinberg's Flask mega tutorial, 
Being very concise and broken up by chapters, I was able to follow along and really learn the foundamentals of flask and web development
I learned about flask itself, web forms, such as login and sign ups, database models, routes and html templates working alongside jinja

# Journey
After feeling as if I learnt enough from the tuturial after a month or so, I decided to start my very own project with the idea I had a while ago
Overall starting the project felt very straightforward and I was able to understand how to set up the core foundation of everything because of the tuturial
However I wanted to implement something I learnt which I found interesting, bootstrap. By looking online and finding bootstrap templates, I was able to find and select one which I think fit my visualization
Working with boostrap, I learnt and struggled with something that was not covered on the tuturial from where I read up to, which was charts and how to connect them with forms 
This proved to be a hardship in my journey, but really led me to research more and figure out just how to connect everything together. There was a lot of trial of error and desk slamming moments, but i was happy with the final production

# Final Takes
I feel as if this project has really just opened the door to the computer science web development and overall project creation. 
Being able to first sit and learn and watch people teach me how to use certain parts of a project and then implementing them in my own way, was genuially game breaking for me
I really value this project as my first project and I hope I can come back to this and improve upon it
My next goal that I want to learn and create a project more about, is javascript
